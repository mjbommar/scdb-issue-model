# SCDB Issue Modeling

This research project attempts to develop models to assist in the prediction of Supreme Court cases; initially, the
goal is to predict the issue and issue area coding of a case.

Due to the _ex post_ nature of SCDB coding and its focus on the published opinion, there are a number of challenges to
out-of-sample, _ex ante_ application.  However, we will attempt to evaluate the degree of the problem through a historical
walk-forward simulation of such a model to _ex ante_ documents such as lower court opinions, briefs, and docket entries.
